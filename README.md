# General-Product-Discovery-Training

General training activity for Product Discovery using Google Design Sprint methodology. Part of the PO with AI training module.

## DesignSprintAgent

This workspace includes a custom GitHub Copilot agent — **DesignSprintAgent** — that guides a Product Owner through the first four phases of a [Google Design Sprint](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview):

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Understand | Build shared knowledge of the problem space | Sprint Brief, Expert/User Interviews, User Journey Map, HMW Notes |
| 2 — Define | Focus on the highest-impact problem to solve | Cluster HMW Notes, Problem Statement, Sprint Questions, User Persona |
| 3 — Sketch | Generate a wide and diverse set of solutions | Lightning Demos, Crazy 8s, Solution Sketching, Silent Review |
| 4 — Decide | Select the best solution to move forward | Gallery Walk, Heatmap Voting, Speed Critique, Supervote, Storyboard |

### How to Use

1. Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** in this repository.
2. Invoke the agent by typing `@DesignSprintAgent` followed by your message.
3. The agent will ask which phase you are on and guide you from there.
4. All artefacts are automatically saved to the [`design-sprint/`](./design-sprint/) directory.

### Example Prompts

- `@DesignSprintAgent I'm starting a new Design Sprint. Where do I begin?`
